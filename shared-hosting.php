<h1 class="g-heading" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="color: #ff9900;">Terms of Service for Hosting</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong class="red">1.) Account Setup / Email on file</strong><br />
We will setup your account after we have received payment and we and/or our payment partner(s) have screened the order(s) in case of fraud. It is your responsibility to provide us with an email address which is not @ the domain(s) you are signing up under. If there is ever an abuse issue or we need to contact you, the primary email address on file will be used for this purpose. It is your responsibility to ensure the email address on file is current or up to date at all times. If you have a domain name registered with MI-Soft BD, it is your responsibility to ensure that the contact information for your domain account and your actual domain name(s) is correct and up-to-date. MI-Soft BD is not responsible for a lapsed registration due to outdated contact information being associated with the domain. If you need to verify or change this information, you should contact our sales team via email. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. In dedicated server purchases or high risk transactions, it will be necessary to provide government issued identification and possibly a scan of the credit card used for the purchase. If you fail to meet these requirements, the order may be considered fraudulent in nature and be denied.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ownership</strong><br />
Biller e-mail address which is utilized for payment on the account is designated as the authorized owner of the account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Transfers</strong><br />
Our transfer’s team will make every effort to help you move your site to us. However, transfers are provided as a courtesy service, and we cannot make guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult if not impossible to migrate some or all account data. We will try our best, but in some cases we may be unable to assist you in a transfer of data from an old host.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dedicated IP Address Allocation</strong><br />
Any dedicated IP order in addition to ones provided with a hosting package may be subject to IP Justification. Justification practices are subject to change to remain in conformity with policies of American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). We reserve the right to deny any dedicated IP request based on insufficient justification or current IP utilization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Third Party Providers</strong><br />
All transactions with third party providers are solely between the visitor and the individual provider. MI-Soft BD is not the agent, representative, trustee or fiduciary of you or the third party provider in any transaction. Some products provided by MI-Soft BD are provided under license with vendors, and the use of any such third party products will be governed by the applicable license agreement, if any, with such third party.<br />
All discounts, promotions and special third party offers may be subject to additional restrictions and limitations by the third party provider. All transactions with third party providers are subject to the terms and conditions under which the provider agrees with you to provide the goods or services. You should confirm the terms of any purchase and/or use of goods or services with the specific provider with whom you are dealing.<br />
We do not make any representations or warranties regarding, and are not liable for, the quality, availability, or timeliness of goods or services provided by a third party provider. You undertake all transactions with these providers at your own risk. We do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding third party providers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">2.) Content</strong><br />
All services provided by MI-Soft BD may only be used for lawful purposes. The laws of the State of Florida, the State of Texas, and the United States of America apply.<br />
The customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless MI-Soft BD from any claims resulting from the use of our services.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">MI-Soft BD services, including all related equipment, networks and network devices are provided only for authorized customer use. MI-Soft BD systems may be monitored for all lawful purposes, including to ensure that use is authorized, for management of the system, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and operational security. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied and used for authorized purposes. Use of MI-Soft BD system(s) constitutes consent to monitoring for these purposes.<br />
Any account found connecting to a third party network or system without authorization from the third party is subject to suspension. Access to networks or systems outside of your direct control must be with expressed written consent from the third party. MI-Soft BD may, at its discretion, request and require documentation to prove access to a third party network or system is authorized.<br />
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Any material that, in our judgment, is obscene, threatening, illegal, or violates our terms of service in any manner may be removed from our servers (or otherwise disabled), with or without notice.<br />
Failure to respond to email from our abuse department within 48 hours may result in the suspension or termination of your services. All abuse issues must be dealt with via troubleticket/email and will have a response within 48 hours.<br />
Sites hosted on MI-Soft BD&#8217;s service(s) are regulated only by U.S. law. Given this fact, and pursuant to Section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act, we do not remove allegedly defamatory material from domains hosted on our service(s). The only exception to this rule is if the material has been found to be defamatory by a court, as evidenced by a court order. MI-Soft BD is not in a position to investigate and validate or invalidate the veracity of individual defamation claims, which is why we rely on the legal system and courts to determine whether or not material is indeed considered defamatory. In any case in which a court order indicates material is defamatory, libelous, or slanderous in nature; we will disable access to the material. Similarly, in any case in which a US Court has placed an injunction against specified content or material; we will comply and remove or disable access to the material in question.<br />
The language of Section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act fundamentally states that Internet services providers like MI-Soft BD and many of ZMI-Soft BD&#8217;s other webhosting services and brands are republishes and not the publisher of content. Our service merely provides a hosting platform and space on which to host content, and any creation or publication of content on our services is the sole responsibility of the third-party user which creates or publishes the content. Therefore, MI-Soft BD should not be held liable for any allegedly defamatory, offensive or harassing content published on sites hosted under MI-Soft BD&#8217;s webhosting service(s).<br />
If in doubt regarding the acceptability of your site or service, please contact us at abuse@MI-Soft BD and we will be happy to assist you.<br />
Potential harm to minors is strictly forbidden, including but not limited to child pornography or content perceived to be child pornography (Lolita):<br />
Any site found to host child pornography or linking to child pornography will be suspended immediately without notice.<br />
Resellers: we will suspend the site in question and will notify you so you may terminate the account. We will further monitor your activity; more than one infraction of this type may result in the immediate termination of your account.<br />
Direct customers: Your services will be terminated with or without notice.<br />
Violations will be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.<br />
<strong>It is your responsibility to ensure that scripts/programs installed under your account are secure and permissions of directories are set properly, regardless of installation method. When at all possible, set permissions on most directories to 755 or as restrictive as possible. Users are ultimately responsible for all actions taken under their account. This includes the compromise of credentials such as user name and password. It is required that you use a secure password. If a weak password is used, your account may be suspended until you agree to use a more secure password. Audits may be done to prevent weak passwords from being used. If an audit is performed, and your password is found to be weak, we will notify you and allow time for you to change/update your password.</strong><br />
<strong>HIPAA Disclaimer</strong> We are not “HIPAA compliant.&#8221;<br />
Users are solely responsible for any applicable compliance with federal or state laws governing the privacy and security of personal data, including medical or other sensitive data.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">3.) Zero Tolerance Spam Policy</strong><br />
We take a zero tolerance stance against sending of unsolicited e-mail, bulk emailing, and spam. &#8220;Safe lists&#8221;, purchased lists, and selling of lists will be treated as spam. Any user who sends out spam will have their account terminated with or without notice.<br />
Sites advertised via SPAM (Spamvertised) may not be hosted on our servers. This provision includes, but is not limited to SPAM sent via fax, phone, postal mail, email, instant messaging, or usenet/newsgroups. No organization or entity listed in the <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/rokso/index.lasso">ROKSO</a> may be hosted on our servers. Any account which results in our IP space being blacklisted will be immediately suspended and/or terminated.<br />
MI-Soft BD reserves the right to require changes or disable as necessary any web site, account, database, or other component that does not comply with its established policies, or to make any such modifications in an emergency at its sole discretion.<br />
MI-Soft BD reserves the right to charge the holder of the account used to send any unsolicited e-mail a clean up fee or any charges incurred for blacklist removal. This cost of the clean up fee is entirely at the discretion of MI-Soft BD.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">4.) Payment Information</strong><br />
You agree to supply appropriate payment for the services received from MI-Soft BD, in advance of the time period during which such services are provided. Subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, all payments will apply to the oldest invoice(s) in your billing account. You agree that until and unless you notify MI-Soft BD of your desire to cancel any or all services received, those services will be billed on a recurring basis.<br />
As a client of MI-Soft BD, it is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up to date, and that all invoices are paid on time. You agree that until and unless you notify MI-Soft BD of your desire to cancel any or all services received (by the proper means listed in the appropriate section of the Terms of Service), those services will be billed on a recurring basis, unless otherwise stated in writing by MI-Soft BD. MI-Soft BD reserves the right to bill your credit card or billing information on file with us. MI-Soft BD provides a 10 day grace period from the time the invoice is generated and when it must be paid. Any invoice that is outstanding for 10 days and not paid will result in a $10 late fee and/or an account suspension until account balance has been paid in full. The $10 late fee is applied in addition to whatever else is owed to MI-Soft BD for services rendered. Access to the account will not be restored until payment has been received.<br />
MI-Soft BD reserves the right to change the monthly payment amount and any other charges at anytime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">5.) Backups and Data Loss</strong><br />
Your use of this service is at your sole risk. Our backup service runs once a week, overwrites any of our previous backups made, and only one week of backups are kept. This service is provided to you as a courtesy. MI-Soft BD is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. You agree to take full responsibility for files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate backup of files and data stored on MI-Soft BD servers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">6.) Cancellations and Refunds</strong><br />
MI-Soft BD reserves the right to cancel, suspend, or otherwise restrict access to the account at any time with or without notice.<br />
Exchange rate fluctuations for international payments are constant and unavoidable. All refunds are processed in U.S. dollars, and will reflect the exchange rate in effect on the date of the refund. All refunds are subject to this fluctuation and MI-Soft BD is not responsible for any change in exchange rates between time of payment and time of refund.<br />
Cancellations requested after the initial 45 days for Shared and Reseller accounts will go into effect on the renewal date for that particular hosting package. Unless specifically requested, the account will remain active until the period expires. If the account is eligible, any request for a refund outside of the initial 45 day period will be given on a prorated basis with any previous extended term discount withheld. Refunds are to be determined once the account has been canceled. Payments older than 60 days may require a refund via PayPal or mailed check due to our merchant account policies and procedures.<br />
The following methods of payments are non-refundable, and refunds will be posted as credit to the hosting account:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;" type="disc">
<li>Bank Wire Transfers</li>
<li>Western Union Payments</li>
<li>Checks</li>
<li>Money orders</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no refunds on dedicated servers, administrative fees, and install fees for custom software. Refund requests for .com, .net., and .org domain names (made within the 45 day money-back guarantee period) will have the common market value subtracted for those tld&#8217;s. Any ccTLD&#8217;s domain name purchases are non-refundable. Please note that domain refunds will only be considered if they were ordered in conjunction with a hosting package. Eligibility of said refunds will be determined at the time of cancellation.<br />
Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you&#8217;ve had an account with us before, canceled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or if you have opened a second account with us.<br />
<strong>Violations of the Terms of Service will waive the refund policy.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">7a.) Resource Usage</strong><br />
User may not:<br />
1) Use 25% or more of system resources for longer then 90 seconds. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems; these include: CGI scripts, FTP, PHP, HTTP, etc.<br />
2) Run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes at any point in time on the server. This includes any and all daemons, such as IRCD.<br />
3) Run any type of web spider or indexer (including Google Cash / AdSpy) on shared servers.<br />
4) Run any software that interfaces with an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network.<br />
5) Run any bit torrent application, tracker, or client. You may link to legal torrents off-site, but may not host or store them on our shared servers.<br />
6) Participate in any file-sharing/peer-to-peer activities<br />
7) Run any gaming servers such as counter-strike, half-life, battlefield1942, etc<br />
8) Run cron entries with intervals of less than 15 minutes.<br />
9) Run any MySQL queries longer than 15 seconds. MySQL tables should be indexed appropriately.<br />
10) When using PHP include functions for including a local file, include the local file rather than the URL. Instead of include(&#8220;http://yourdomain.com/include.php&#8221;) use include(&#8220;include.php&#8221;)<br />
11) To help reduce usage, do not force html to handle server-side code (like php and shtml).<br />
12) Only use https protocol when necessary; encrypting and decrypting communications is noticeably more CPU-intensive than unencrypted communications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">7b.) INODES </strong><br />
The use of more than 250,000 inodes on any shared account may potentially result in a warning first, and if no action is taken future suspension. Accounts found to be exceeding the 100,000 inode limit will automatically be removed from our backup system to avoid over-usage, however databases will still be backed up. Every file (a webpage, image file, email, etc) on your account uses up 1 inode.<br />
Sites that slightly exceed our inode limits are unlikely to be suspended; however, accounts that constantly create and delete large numbers of files on a regular basis, have hundreds of thousands of files, or cause file system damage may be flagged for review and/or suspension. The primary cause of excessive inodes seems to be due to users leaving their catchall address enabled, but never checking their primary account mailbox. Over time, tens of thousands of messages (or more) build up, eventually pushing the account past our inode limit. To disable your default mailbox, login to cPanel and choose &#8220;Mail&#8221;, then &#8220;Default Address&#8221;, &#8220;Set Default Address&#8221;, and then type in: :fail: No such user here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">7c.) Backup Limit </strong><br />
Any shared account using more than 20 gigs of disk space will be removed from our off site weekly backup with the exception of Databases continuing to be backed up. All data will continue to be mirrored to a secondary drive which helps protect against data loss in the event of a drive failure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">8.) Bandwidth Usage</strong><br />
You are allocated a monthly bandwidth allowance. This allowance varies depending on the hosting package you purchase. Should your account pass the allocated amount we reserve the right to suspend the account until the start of the next allocation, suspend the account until more bandwidth is purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a higher level of package, terminate the account and/or charge you an additional fee for the overages. Unused transfer in one month cannot be carried over to the next month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">9.) Uptime Guarantee</strong><br />
If your shared / reseller server has a physical downtime that is not within the 99.9% uptime you may receive one month of credit on your account. Approval of the credit is at the discretion of MI-Soft BD dependent upon justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor&#8217;s network capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by other individual services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">10.) Reseller: Client Responsibility</strong><br />
Resellers are responsible for supporting their clients. MI-Soft BD does not provide support to our Reseller&#8217;s Clients. If a reseller&#8217;s client contacts us, we reserve the right to place the client account on hold until the reseller can assume their responsibility for their client. All support requests must be made by the reseller on their clients&#8217; behalf for security purposes. Resellers are also responsible for all content stored or transmitted under their reseller account and the actions of their clients&#8217;. MI-Soft BD will hold any reseller responsible for any of their clients actions that violate the law or the terms of service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">11.) Shared (non-reseller accounts) / Semidedicated Servers</strong><br />
Shared accounts may not resell web hosting to other people, if you wish to resell hosting you must use a reseller account. Semi-dedicated servers are not backed up. You must maintain your own backups.<br />
The Business plan provides a free toll-free number for your web site and business. Minutes Included Per Month: 100 &#8212; Additional Minutes: 4.9 Cents. Included minutes are based on a calendar month. By default, you&#8217;ll be able to receive calls from US callers only. You can enable calls from Canada in your control panel, but will be billed 6.9 cents per minute for all calls from Canada due to the increased costs of providing service there. This service is provided and supported by Voipo for new MI-Soft BD clients.<br />
*Please note: Toll-Free numbers issued must be called at least once every 30 days. Toll-free numbers with 0 calls in a 30 day period will be considered inactive and disconnected. If you cancel your hosting package with MI-Soft BD or switch to a plan other than the business plan, your toll-free number will be disconnected unless you contact VOIPo to change to a paid service plan prior to the MI-Soft BD cancellation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="red">12.) Dedicated Servers</strong><br />
MI-Soft BD reserves the right to reset the password on a dedicated server if the password on file is not current so that we may do security audits as required by our datacenter. It is the responsibility of the client to ensure that there is a valid email address and current root password on file for their dedicated server on file to prevent downtime from forced password resets. MI-Soft BD reserves the right to audit servers as needed and to perform administrative actions at the request of our datacenter. Dedicated servers are NOT backed up by us and it is the responsibility of the client to maintain backups or have a solution for this. It is your responsibility to maintain backups.</p>
